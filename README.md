Hi, I'm Karthik 👋  
------------------

I'm a **product engineer and technical leader** based in Berlin, Germany — passionate about building scalable systems, designing clean architectures, and turning ideas into impactful products.  
I love working at the intersection of **engineering, design, and business**, where technology directly shapes user experience and product growth.

Currently, I'm tinkering with **AI-driven workflows** — exploring ways to combine **LLMs**, **automation**, and **event-driven systems** to make engineering processes smarter and faster.

In the past, I’ve worked on large-scale replatforming projects, developer tooling, and cloud-native systems.  
I’m always learning, sharing, and building things that solve real problems elegantly.
